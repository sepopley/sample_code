The src directory contains a java implementation of q3 (MarsRover). Assumptions of the implementation are in the header of MarsRover.java

Running instructions: 
In the terminal, cd into the src directory. 
To compile the file: javac MarsRover.java
To run the file: java MarsRover.java

By default, this runs the program with the given input for the problem. 
 * 1) input.txt -> Given test cases
 * 2) bounds.txt -> Test cases for all four bounds of the grid
 * 3) collision1.txt -> Test case for collision with starting position
 * 4) collision2.txt -> Test case for collision while the rover moves around the grid

To specify the input file you would like to use, run as: 
java MarsRover.java bounds.txt
(or so on)  

I compiled, ran, and tested my code on a mac with the following version of Java: 
java version "1.7.0_05"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_05-b06)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.1-b03, mixed mode)
